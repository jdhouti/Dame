# Dame
A simple application written in python 3 that will perform a customized analysis on a chosen file.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get the program running on your computer.

### Prerequisites

Python libraries that you will need installed are:
* pandas - for file analysis
* matplotlib - for graphing engine
* sklearn - for linear regression
* numpy - for front end

For help installing these, you can use `pip`:
```
$pip install pandas
$pip install matplotlib
$pip install sklearn
$pip install numpy
```

### Installing

Once the above libraries are installed on your computer, installing **Dame** is very simple.
Simply download the project folder and the project will now be on your computer.

To run the program, navigate into the project folder and execute, ***in Python 3***, the `main.py` file.

### Tests

* `column_info_test.py`: Deprecated test.
* `data_analysis_test.py`: Tests the data_object object and its attributes.
* `file_name_generator_test.py`: Deprecated test. Used to test the name generator function.
* `histogram_test.py`: Tests the Histogram object.
* `tinkter_matplotlib_test.py`: Tests the interface of the program.

## Built With

* [Tkinter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter) - The front interface used
* [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) - Graph generator engine
* [Sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - Used to generate linear regression
