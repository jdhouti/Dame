# Sources
These are the sources that we used to build this project.

## General
+ We used some of [Google's Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) to write all of our docstrings.

+ For other style conventions, we used [PEP8's style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). Please note that contributions should follow these guidelines, just like any other python script that you write.

## Backend development
+ ~~To view, edit, and save images, the [PIL Fork](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/4.0.x/reference/Image.html) python module is used.~~

+ To conduct testing for backend development, we used the [Unit testing framework](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html). All documented testing can be found in the **test** folder.

+ To write the `lin_generate()` function, we used [polyfit](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.polyfit.html) from the **numpy library**.

## Frontend development
+ To make the front end code compatible with python 3, we used information on the [python 3 porting site](http://python3porting.com/stdlib.html).
