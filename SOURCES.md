# Sources
These are the sources that we used to build this project.

## Backend development
To view, edit, and save images, the [PIL Fork](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/4.0.x/reference/Image.html) python module is used.

To conduct testing for backend development, we used the [Unit testing framework](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html). All documented testing can be found in the **test** folder.

To make the front end code compatible with python 3, information was found on the [python 3 porting site](http://python3porting.com/stdlib.html).
