# Sources
These are the sources that we used to build this project.

## General
+ We used some of [Google's Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) to write most of our methods.

## Backend development
+ To view, edit, and save images, the [PIL Fork](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/4.0.x/reference/Image.html) python module is used.

+ To conduct testing for backend development, we used the [Unit testing framework](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html). All documented testing can be found in the **test** folder.

+ To write the `lin_generate()` function, we used [this tutorial](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/linear_model/plot_ols.html) from **Scikit-learn's** website.

## Frontend development
+ To make the front end code compatible with python 3, information was found on the [python 3 porting site](http://python3porting.com/stdlib.html).
